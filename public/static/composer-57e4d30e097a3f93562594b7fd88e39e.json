    "shortDefinition": "The technology used to download items that works manages dependencies in PHP. This tool allows users to specify libraries to be used and it manages the installation and updates for the libraries. \n\nA “package” is the composer’s smallest unit of delivery. Example: A .zip file containing a directory tree of files. Composer places each Magento component — module, theme or language pack — to be downloaded into a separate package, creating a 1:1 relationship between components and packages."
