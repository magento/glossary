    "shortDefinition": "The process of injecting new code before, after, or around an existing public function of a PHP class. \n\nTo intercept a function, a plug-in implements the additional code to be invoked. Plug-ins are associated with interception points by the dependency injection configuration file (di.xml). If multiple plug-ins are defined on the same function, the dependency injection configuration defines the order in which the plug-ins are invoked, allowing multiple plug-ins to be used without conflict.",
