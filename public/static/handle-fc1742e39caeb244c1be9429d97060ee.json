    "shortDefinition": "Generally, a handle is a way to reference an object. In Magento, handles are used in many places, most commonly to identify a page. For page handles, the handle name is derived from the URL, then used to locate and load the layout files for the referenced page.",
    "longDefinition": "For example, in the Magento Customer module, there is a layout file called “view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_index.xml”. Here “frontend” is the area name and “checkout_cart_index” is the handle name, both of which are derived from the URL."
