For page handles, the handle name is derived from the URL, then used to locate and load the layout files for the referenced page.\nFor example, in the Magento Customer module, there is a layout file called “view/frontend/layout/checkout<em>cart</em>index.xml”. Here “frontend” is the area name and “checkout<em>cart</em>index” is the handle name, both of which are derived from the URL.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"handle","wordClasses":["noun"],"tags":["programming"],"synonyms":["page handle"],"relatedTerms":[]},"fields":{"slug":"/handle/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/handle/"}}
