    "shortDefinition": "Stands for \"Leaner CSS\". Simply put, Less combines CSS language (which applies visual styles to HTML pages) with other items - embedded variables, mixins, functions, and other features. \n\nThis combination enables CSS to be themed and more maintainable and extendable. As a pre-processor, Less processes and exports its code into a standard CSS file that browsers can read and render into web pages.",
