Vendor-produced code that extends or customizes Magento behavior and operates as a third-party extension is considered a Vendor Bundled Extension (VBE). VBEs are thoroughly tested and included with each supported version of Magento Open Source and Magento Commerce. A Magento bundled extension (MBE) can include modules, themes, and language packs.
