Continuous integration, continuous delivery (CICD) is the process of continuously building and testing new code changes and deploying new versions of an application frequently. Continuous integration is a prerequisite for CICD and ensures developers commit their changes to the main code branch multiple times per day. Each code merge is used to initiate an automated code build and testing process.
