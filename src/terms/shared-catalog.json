    "shortDefinition": "A feature that allows merchants to create a catalog that can serve as their entire catalog or a subset of it, and then assign custom prices for one or more products. Merchants can then assign this catalog to one or more companies.\n\nFor example, a B2B merchant has three customers who’ve negotiated specific rates for his electronics distribution site. Using the shared catalog feature, the merchant has:\n• a main catalog\n• a customer 1 catalog (perhaps it’s just three SKUs with heavy discounts on them from the main catalog)\n• customer 2 catalog (could be the entire catalog with 10% off)\n• customer 3 catalog (a few dozen products with discounts off the main catalog ranging from 5% - 60%).",
