A web application firewall (WAF) aids in the protection of web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It protects web applications from a variety of attacks, including cross-site forgery, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection. A WAF is a protection at protocol layer 7 (in the OSI model) and is not meant to guard against all forms of attacks.
