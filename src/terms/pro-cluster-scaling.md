Adobe Commerce Pro cluster scaling can scale from the smallest Pro12 cluster to the largest Pro120 cluster.

* Pro12 offers a 12-CPU (4 x 3 nodes) and 48GB RAM (16 x 3 nodes)
* Pro120 offers 120 CPU (40 x 3 nodes) up to 480GB RAM (160 x 3 nodes)

The Adobe Commerce redundant architecture means Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure offers upscaling without downtime. When upscaling, Adobe rotates each of the three instances to upgrade capacity without impacting site operation.
