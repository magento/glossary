The frontend component, or client, is an interface on a local computer or workstation that and enables users to access the remote server and manipulate the backend code. A user cannot directly access backend code.\n\nIn Magento, customers interact with the storefront (UI), merchants interact with the Magento Admin (front end client / browser). These interactions launch the server-side \"backend\" code, or Magento application programs, remotely.",
