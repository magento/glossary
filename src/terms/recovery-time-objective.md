The recovery time objective (RTO) is the longest amount of time that an application, computer, network, or system can be down after an unexpected disaster, failure, or similar event. 

The RTO for Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure depends on the size of the storage. Large EBS volumes take more time to restore.
