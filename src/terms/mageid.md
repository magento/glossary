The Magento ID (MAGEID) is typically the billing contact on the Adobe Commerce account (and may not be the Project Owner of the Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure project). For access entitlement to Adobe Commerce and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure packages, you must use access keys associated with a MAGEID that has been granted access to those packages.
