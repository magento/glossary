Scope can apply to the following:\n• Global — all websites, stores, and store views\n• Website — the selected website and all stores and store views under it\n• Store — the selected store and all store views under it\n• Store View — the selected store view. \nWithin the hierarchy, settings applied at a lower level can override some higher-level settings."
