    "shortDefinition": "Where one or more \"publishers\" can send a message on a message bus without knowing who is interested in the message. Subscribers can listen to the message by \"subscribing\". The pattern is normally used as a one-to-many broadcast of messages, but it can be used as many-to-many, if appropriate."
