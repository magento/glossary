A hyperlink that includes only the address of the linked page that is relative to the linking page, rather than the full URL.

A relative link needs the full URL of the current page to be resolved. Web browsers resolve relative links into full links before sending to a web server. Relative links frequently are used to reference web assets located in the same directory as the current asset. (Example: "style.css" is a relative link.)
