A cache stores data so that future calls for that data can be loaded quicker, and Magento includes these types: configuration, layout, block HTML layout, full page (the most well-known), collections, DDL, EAV, reflection, translation, integration configuration, integration API configuration, web services configuration. Other types can be created and defined.
