[PWA Studio](https://magento-research.github.io/pwa-studio/)  uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) for development. React officially describes itself as a _JavaScript library for building user interfaces_. The library provides many features that make PWA development easier: builds UIs, declarative for describing the interface based on application states, and creates modular and reusable UI components.
