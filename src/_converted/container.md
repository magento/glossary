A type of node in a layout tree (along with blocks and UI components), a container is a defined region on a page that generates HTML (composed as an array of variable items in an ordered list) with CSS attributes.

The attributes of a container include visibility, horizontal and vertical alignment, autoresizing, edibility, position, and size.
