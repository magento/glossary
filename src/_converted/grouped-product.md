A product type with several similar, standalone products grouped on a single page.  Can be offered with variations of a single product or by grouping them by season or theme to create a coordinated set. Each product can be purchased separately, or as part of the group.

For example, for a knife that's available in four sizes, all four knives can be displayed within a grouped product page. Customers can select the sizes they want and add them to the cart from this page.
