The primary currency that is used per store view for all online payments. Stores can accept currencies from more than two hundred countries around the world. The store front provides a currency selector for multiple accepted currencies for a specific country or locale. Currency symbols appear in product prices and sales documents such as orders and invoices. You can customize the currency symbols as needed, and also set the display of the price separately for each store or view.
