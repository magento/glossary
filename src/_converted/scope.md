In Magento, scope describes the extent of your store hierarchy that a setting can affect. Scope can apply to the following:

* Global — all websites, stores, and store views
* Website — the selected website and all stores and store views under it
* Store — the selected store and all store views under it
* Store View — the selected store view.

Within the hierarchy, settings applied at a lower level can override some higher-level settings.
