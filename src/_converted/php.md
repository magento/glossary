An open-source, server-side (backend) scripting language designed mainly for web development. The script is embedded within a Web pageâ€™s HTML. When a user has requested the page, the Web server calls PHP to read the script and perform its operation.

PHP pages typically have file name suffixes that include: ".php" ".php3," or ".phtml". PHP pages are dynamic, driven by the how the script is read.
