A platform — used by Magento Cloud — that features cloud computing services that enable the development and management of applications.

PaaS does not require customers to buy and manage infrastructure, including hardware, software, network, servers operating systems and storage. Customers can control running applications and, in some cases, the application-hosting configuration settings. “PaaS” can be used on second reference.
