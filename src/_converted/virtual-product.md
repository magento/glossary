Represents a non-physical product that can be sold, such as a membership, service, warranty, or subscription. Virtual products can be sold individually, or included as part of the following product types: grouped product and bundle product. Does not require shipping or inventory.

The process of creating a virtual product and a simple product is nearly the same. However, because a virtual product is not shipped, there is no Weight field or option to include a gift card.
