An installation tool that automatically deploys Magento software into a local environment, creating a pre-built environment that can be installed on Mac or Windows. When installation is complete, the “Docker container” will run on Linux, including the Magento 2 source code, an Apache web server, and a MySQL database server. The web server and database server have the Magento 2 Luma demo store pre-loaded.
