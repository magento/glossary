MFTF stands for [Magento Functional Testing Framework](https://devdocs.magento.com/mftf/docs/introduction.html). It provides a testing framework for Magento developers and software engineers, such as QA specialists, PHP developers, and system integrators. Developers and QA can write tests to attempt user interactions with web applications, verify functionality, and automate regression testing.
