A unit of page output that renders some distinctive content – a piece of information, a user interface element – anything visually tangible for the end-user. [Blocks](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/cms/blocks.html) are implemented and provided by modules. Blocks use templates to generate HTML. Examples of blocks include a category list, a mini cart, product tags, and product listing.

[Dynamic blocks](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/dynamic-blocks.html) provide content based on logic, such as price rules.

Page Builder expands on the interactivity and creation of [blocks](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-add-content-block.html) and [dynamic blocks](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-add-dynamic-block.html).
