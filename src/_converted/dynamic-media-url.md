A URL address that is generated dynamically by the system to reference an image or other media. The address links directly to assets stored on a server or a content delivery network.
To use a static URL, change the configuration setting. However, if dynamic media URLs are included in your catalog when you disable the setting, each reference in your catalog will become a broken link. Links can be restored by again enabling dynamic media URLs. Using dynamic media URLs can affect catalog search's performance.

Code format: media url="path/to/image.jpg"
