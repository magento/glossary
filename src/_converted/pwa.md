A Progressive Web App, or PWA, is a web application that uses modern web technologies and design patterns to provide a reliable, fast, and engaging user experience. PWA sites are fast, secure, responsive for all devices, cross-browser compatible, supports an offline mode, etc.

The Magento PWA Studio project is a set of developer tools that allow for the development, deployment, and maintenance of a PWA storefront on top of Magento 2. It uses modern [tools and libraries](https://magento-research.github.io/pwa-studio/technologies/tools-libraries/) to create a build system and framework that adheres to the Magento principle of extensibility.

PWA is also a Magento Community Engineering project, open to contributions:
