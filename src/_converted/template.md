Short for HTML template or PHTML template. A PHTML file contains a mixture of HTML markup and PHP code to inject dynamic content into the HTML. Most blocks have at least one PHTML (template) file that contains the static HTML generated by the block.
In the Admin, email and newsletter templates combine text, images, and variables with HTML markup to produce personalized content that is sent by the system.
