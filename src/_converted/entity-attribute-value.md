For database entities, a data model that efficiently encodes entities. Stores the entity id, attribute name, and value as a triple, which allows new entity attribute names to be created at any time. In encoding, the number of attributes that can be used to describe entities can scale extensively, but the number that applies to a given entity is minimized. This data model is very flexible, but can be slow.
